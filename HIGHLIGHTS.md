I recently completed a comprehensive project focused on analyzing and visualizing network latency patterns using traceroute logs. This project was a significant learning experience and a demonstration of my ability to lead and develop a full-stack application from concept to completion, leveraging AI assistance.

### Project Highlights:

- **Full-Stack Development**: This project represents my first foray into full-stack development, where I designed and implemented a complete application with both backend and frontend components.
  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Using Streamlit, I developed an intuitive and interactive GUI that allows users to upload and analyze traceroute logs effortlessly. This experience honed my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces and managing user input dynamically.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: I gained hands-on experience with data analysis using Pandas, and visualization with Matplotlib. The project involved plotting various latency metrics over time, identifying high latency periods, and visualizing incremental latency for specific network hops. This enhanced my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through visual representations.

- **Networking Insights**: Working with traceroute logs required a deep understanding of network operations and latency issues. This project improved my understanding of network diagnostics and the practical applications of traceroute in identifying network performance bottlenecks.

- **Project Management and Collaboration**: As the project lead, I guided the development process, making strategic decisions and ensuring the project stayed on track. This experience underscores my ability to manage projects, collaborate effectively, and utilize AI tools to enhance productivity and problem-solving.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For developing the interactive web-based GUI.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating detailed and informative plots.
- **Traceroute**: For generating and analyzing network diagnostic logs.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:

- Full-stack development capabilities
- GUI design and implementation
- Advanced data analysis and visualization
- Networking and network diagnostics understanding
- Effective project management and leadership
- Strategic use of AI tools for development assistance
